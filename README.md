# Notes

This projects use [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) and local storage for database. So it works offline. For REST API example please switch to the `with-nowdb` [branch](https://github.com/rangerkuning/polymer-simple-crud-app/tree/with-nowdb).

## Install

Just do `bower install` then `polymer serve` or open `index.html` in browser
